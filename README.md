**ULEZ_Checker**

Basic script to check a vehicles ULEZ compliance. Can be run interactively in the terminal or imported and used as a 
function. It uses a hidden API which may or may not be allowed under Ts & Cs.

This was intended to accompany a number plate recognition project but that has proved to be unrealistic.
